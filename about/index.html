              I&#39;ve spent the past twelve years working towards the goal of delivering people great experiences. Whether that&#39;s through development, design, or simply taking time to empathize with the problem I&#39;m hoping to solve.

We think we know who we are and what we want to be&hellip; until we look back and realize how little we knew.</h4>
<p>In 2011, Steve Jobs gave a keynote to introduce the then-new iPad. One of the first screens in his slideshow displayed a street sign that analogizes the intersection of technology and liberal arts. That image has always stuck with me because I best believe it represents what I&rsquo;ve been working to accomplish the last twelve years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a fascination with technology and an appreciation for design. Right from high school, I was designing web sites or creating print pamphlets for family and friends. I also loved computers; I would tear apart my family&rsquo;s PC just so I could try putting it back together, I would customize the Windows OS to the point that I would have to wipe and start over because I broke it so badly.</p>
<h4 id="ive-always-had-a-fascination-with-technology-and-an-appreciation-for-design">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a fascination with technology and an appreciation for design&rdquo;</h4>
<p>I knew design and technology were interests I wanted to pursue as a career but wasn&rsquo;t sure of the best avenue to pursue it. Technology seemed the most obvious to me so in 2006, I moved to Saskatoon and enrolled in Computer Systems Technology at the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (that school is now called Saskatchewan Polytechnic but I will always lovingly refer to it as SIAST). The program focused heavily on programming but I always managed to prioritize design within my projects. In 2008 I graduated with a diploma and, three weeks later, began my career at PCL Construction as a System Administrator.</p>
<p>The work was fine and I enjoyed it; but what I really enjoyed were the dev projects I got to spend my spare time on. I even managed to build an app that created a lot of buzz across several districts at PCL. The side work started to make me think: I.T. wasn&rsquo;t challenging me anymore, and I took so much satisfaction seeing something I developed have such a profound effect on people&rsquo;s work-lives. I believed that software development was my gig, so after a few emails, a few phone-calls, and a very glossy web 2.0-style portfolio was created, I landed myself a developer position at PCL&rsquo;s head office in Edmonton.</p>
<h4 id="i-love-solving-problems-but-i-felt-like-i-was-solving-the-wrong-ones">&ldquo;I love solving problems, but I felt like I was solving the wrong ones&rdquo;</h4>
<p>I spent the first few years diligently working away on various web and desktop projects for PCL, which ranged from VB6, ASP.NET, C#, WPF, Xamarin, and on and on. Again, I took any opportunity to inject design into the project I was working on. After a while, though, I became frustrated. I love solving problems, but I felt like I was solving the wrong ones. Developers love coding, spending hours in front of an IDE trying to make their code more efficient and more elegant; I don&rsquo;t. I realized I would way rather spend time with people, both socially and within the business process. Even when I coded, I was way more interested in providing something usable by the customer as opposed to efficient in the back-end.</p>
<p>Again, I began to think. I pondered what I loved about development and what I didn&rsquo;t. It came back to the original reward: seeing people&rsquo;s every-day lives affected by something I created. I placed value on understanding the customers&rsquo; needs, frustrations, wants. I valued good design in an application and the benefit it brings to the final product.</p>
<h4 id="i-valued-good-design-in-an-application-and-the-benefit-it-brings-to-the-final-product">&ldquo;I valued good design in an application and the benefit it brings to the final product&rdquo;</h4>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you the date or scenario where I found it, but learned about this burgeoning field called User Experience. This sounded fascinating and I had to know more! I started looking up resources online and even found an introductory course to UX provided by the Akendi Institute 
<a class="content-link" href="https://www.akendi.ca/ux-training" target="_blank">[Go to akendi.ca]</a>. This made sense to me, it was that marriage of technology and liberal arts that Steve Jobs talked about. The ability listen to users, hear their needs, wants, and frustrations, and begin the journey to providing a solution that actually solved their problems.</p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve taken on the responsibilities of both UX, UI, and front-end development at PCL. PCL has been good enough to entrust me with trying something new that we&rsquo;ve never done before. It&rsquo;s tough making a paradigm shift but the results are already starting to prove themselves. PCL&rsquo;s applications are easier to use than they&rsquo;ve ever been; not only have we captured the needs of the business, but we know what the users are expecting as well. As always, I can see how I can do better; I never stop learning, never stop listening, never stop growing.</p>
